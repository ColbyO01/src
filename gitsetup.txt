git config user.name "Colby Oxley"
git config user.email "col2192523@maricopa.edu"


THE FIRST TIME you set up your repository, you need to edit the first two
git config commands that appear at the top of this file.

1. In the git config user.name command, keep the quotes and
   change "Pat Doe" to your name.
2. In the git config user.email command, keep the quote and 
   change "pat2345678@maricopa.edu" to your email address.

EVERY TIME you clone your repository to a new directory 
INCLUDING the first time you set things up, you need to:

1. Select the git config commands in the first two lines of this file.
2. Use Copy (right-click and press Copy or similar) to copy these lines.
3. Open a Terminal window (under the Terminal menu bar option at the top),
   choose New Terminal.
4. Paste these commands into the terminal window to execute them.
5. Press the enter key to make sure the last command executes.

You will not be able to commit changes unless you copy and paste these commands.

If you have any questions or problems, please contact your instructor.
